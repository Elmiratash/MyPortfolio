Portfolio

User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager‚Äôs needs:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
Mock-Up
The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

Review
You are required to submit BOTH of the following for review:

The URL of the deployed application.

The URL of the GitHub repository that contains your code. Give the repository a unique name and include a README file that describes the project.

Professional Materials

Now that you've had some practice with APIs and have a project to share, you'll be updating your portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer-competitive.

If you are opting out of career services, this is _still a required assignment_. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is _necessary_ if you're applying for jobs, but it's also _critical_ on your journey as a developer.

## Homework Requirements

- Updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.

- Updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 and two exemplary assignments.

## Instructions

1. [Updated Portfolio](#updated-portfolio)

2. [Updated GitHub Profile](#updated-github-profile)

3. [Updated Resume](#updated-resume)

4. [Updated LinkedIn](#updated-linkedin)

## Updated Portfolio

üíÅ Need help updating your Portfolio? Check out the [career services milestone resources for online presence](https://mycareerspot.org/onlinepresence).

Your updated portfolio should:

1. Display your contact information. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a separate email that you will only use for coding, also known as a developer email, and/or a call forwarding service, such as [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/).

2. Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile

3. Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume

4. Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:

   - Project title

   - Link to the deployed version

   - Link to the GitHub repository

   - Screenshot of the deployed application

5. Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.

### Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

- Mobile-first design

- Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

- Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

## Updated GitHub Profile

Employers (and potential collaborators) _will_ look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward.

Your GitHub profile must contain at least the following items:

1. Profile picture or avatar

- A photo or an avatar other than the default Github identicon. (a semi-professional to professional photo or an avatar photo are preferred)

2. Biography

3. Email address. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a developer email.

4. Link to your deployed portfolio

5. At least 2 pinned repositories:

   - Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and go to your profile.

   - Click "Customize your pins"

   - Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share

6. Follow a few of your classmates and/or other developers. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code.

7. README files. Every pinned project should contain a README file with:

   - Title of app

   - Live link to deployed app

   - List of technologies used

   - 1-2 sentences explaining what the app is

   - 2-3 Screenshots / gifs of the app

   - License (usually MIT)

   - Contact information for you and any collaborators

8. Commit history. Every pinned repository should have at least 20 commits.
